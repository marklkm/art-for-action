              Art is a universal language that transcends boundaries and brings
              people together. It has the power to connect diverse communities,
              celebrate unique perspectives, and foster inclusivity. We believe
              that art should be accessible to everyone, regardless of
              background, ability, or circumstance. This guide is about more
              than just viewing art—it's about experiencing, creating, and being
              part of a community that values every voice.

          <h2>Partnership and Possibility</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="sensory_text">'The Sensory Trail'</span> is the result
            of the collaboration between TCBG and DS. The partnership enabled an
            additional student internship position at Trinity Botanic Garden to
            create a separate sensory map of the Garden, to enhance students'
            experience and enjoyment. Funded by DS and supervised by TCBG,
            Heather McLean who graduated from Botany at Trinity in 2023 was
            awarded the internship. While providing horticultural support for
            TCBG staff, Heather immersed herself in all aspects of the Garden.
            Identifying as neurodivergent herself, Heather wanted to share her
            experiences and to map areas, plants and aspects of the Garden which
            offer a variety of - sometimes novel - sensory experiences to
            stimulate or calm the senses. With additional assistance from the
            talented team at disAbility Services the
            <span class="sensory_text">Sensory Trail</span> has been developed
            into a simple app with an audio-visual user-guide to the unique
            sensory elements of each stop.

            As well as a teaching and research facility, the Garden provides a
            unique off-campus resource of quiet, reflective space for students
            and staff to escape the busyness of campus life. We are committed to
            the principle that everyone is entitled to open space, so our gates
            are open to everyone, free of charge.

                    The Gardens are available to visit all year round, except
                    during the Christmas holiday period - opening hours are
                    listed below. Occasionally members of the public are invited
                    in for events, and details of these can be found on the
                    Calendar of Events page on the Trinity College Botanic
                    Garden website. Trinity College Dublin's Botanic Garden sits
                    on a 1.5 hectare site by Palmerston Park.

                  <p>
                    Getting to the Gardens is easy with a leap card. The 140 bus
                    runs every ten minutes from outside Trinity via Rathmines to
                    Dartry. Stay on the bus until the very last stop and the
                    Gardens are a three-minute walk away. Alternatively, take
                    the LUAS Green Line to Cowper and the Gardens are a
                    10-minute walk from there.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Catering facilities are not available at the Gardens so
                    bring your refreshments, but please take all of your rubbish
                    with you when you leave.

                  <p>
                    The Walled Garden and glasshouses are open Monday to Friday
                    from 9 am to 4 pm and accessible via the main front gate on
                    Palmerston Park, or via the rear of Trinity Hall. The West
                    and South Arboretums are accessible 24/7 (access is via
                    Trinity Hall entrance only); however, please note that any
                    planned activities in the arboretums must be notified in
                    advance to Dr Steve Waldren, Curator, at Swaldren@tcd.ie.

                    <b>PLEASE NOTE</b> that most of the surfaces at Trinity
                    College Botanic Garden are a mixture of gravel, and grass,
                    and may be more difficult to traverse for visitors with
                    limited mobility. We are currently working to make the
                    gardens and glasshouses easily accessible to everyone.

                    <strong>Sensory Classification: Quiet Space.</strong> The
                    Botanic Garden is a quiet and peaceful space for the college
                    community to enjoy nature and an incredible collection of
                    plants. During term time, some areas may be slightly busy
                    when the Gardens are being used for teaching, but the
                    majority of the time, they are quiet and peaceful. Visitors
                    are welcome to walk the grounds, explore the glasshouses, or
                    rest, read, and relax with nature. Detailed sensory
                    information is included in the
                    <span class="sensory_text">Sensory Trail</span> of the

                    <strong>What is Sensory Processing?</strong> Sensory
                    processing is the means by which individuals obtain
                    information about the world an their own bodies. (Brown,
                    Steffen-Sanchez, Nicholson, 2019). We all have different
                    sensory needs that can change depending on neurotype, energy
                    levels, mood, context, and mechanism of perception.

                            has also been found to reduce anxiety and decrease
                            stress. How are you feeling today? Do you feel any
                            different after smelling lavender for a moment or
                            two? If you like the smell, break a small sprig off
                            the lavender and carry it round with you while you
                            explore the gardens.

                            Located in a small hut in the Walled Garden, you can
                            peep in the windows and watch honey bees crawling in
                            and out their hive and listen to the faint buzzing.
                            These are one of the main pollinators for the
                            gardens and the reason the trees in the Gardens are
                            so full of fruit every autumn. Note how you feel
                            when you watch bees. Some people find watching
                            beehives calming and hypnotic, others feel
                            uncomfortable and nervous. How does watching and
                            listening to the bees affect you? If you enjoy
                            watching the bees and you are visiting in summer
                            months, look for the tall plant with pale yellow
                            flowers (meadow rue) by the entrance to the South
                            Arboretum. and you should find it teeming with
                            white-tailed bumble bees. Take a moment to watch the
                            bees flit from flower to flower and listen to their
                            gentle buzzing.

                            Cycad house is filled with living fossils and some
                            of these plants evolved more than 250 million years
                            ago. How do you feel standing amongst plants that
                            were a popular food with vegetarian dinosaurs? What
                            does it smell like in the house? Cycads reproduce
                            via cones which are either male or female, and male
                            cones which contain the pollen use different scents
                            to attract and repel pollinators. What does the
                            house smell like to you on your visit? Carefully
                            (they can be sharp) touch some of the leaves. Mature
                            leaves are tough, smooth and often very sharp to
                            deter herbivores. Look around and see if you can
                            spot any cycads growing new leaves. What do they
                            feel like? New leaves on cycads are feel much softer
                            / velvety. This house can be visited all year but
                            the greenhouse is heated in winter to protect these
                            tropical trees from the cold, making it the perfect
                            place to visit if the winter blues have you feeling
                            down. You can visit the heated greenhouse, listen to
                            the rain on the roof, smell the trees, touch the
                            plants and enjoy some outside time in the warm.
