                  This is the fourth year of Trinity's DisAbility Art
                  Exhibition, entitled "Art for Action: Building an Inclusive
                  Future!" The exhibition will run from Monday 2nd through to
                  Friday 6th December in An Mheitheal, Trinity disAbility Hub,
                  Printing House Square. A huge thank you to the Trinity
                  disAbility Service, as well as Declan Treanor (Disability
                  Service Director) and Odhr√°n Mc Laughlin (Project
                  Administrator), for their help and support with the
                  exhibition. We'd like to thank all the artists who submitted
                  their extraordinary and thought-provoking work!
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Art for Action Exhibition will be offically launched by
                  Trinity College Dublin Provost Dr Linda Doyle, on the 2nd
                  December at 18:00, in An Mheitheal, Trinity disAbility Hub,
                  Printing House Square.

                <p>
                  Building an inclusive future means breaking down boundaries
                  and ensuring accessibility for all. No one should face delays
                  or barriers to access essential spaces. Efforts to promote
                  inclusion must go beyond the ephemerality of one-time events,
                  striving instead for lasting systemic changes that ensure
                  accessibility and equality for people with disabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Art for Action: Building an Inclusive Future!" is an
                  inspiring art exhibition that invites disabled students to
                  express their unique perspectives and creativity through art.
                  Held during Disability Week, this event celebrates disability
                  as an integral part of personal identity‚Äîchallenging the
                  misconceptions that disability is merely a flaw or loss.
                  Instead, "Art for Action" emphasises that disability
                  contributes a distinct richness to our communities,
                  encouraging us to see it as a source of pride and strength. As
                  we envision a more inclusive future, disability must be
                  central to that vision, fostering a world where diverse ways
                  of experiencing and navigating life are embraced and valued.
                  By showcasing the artistry and resilience of disabled
                  students, this exhibition aims to broaden societal
                  understanding and build a foundation for inclusion, where
                  everyone's voice and perspective contribute to a vibrant,
                  multifaceted community.

                  The inspiration for creating this was the feeling of
                  loneliness, and emptiness that can be viewed as a disability.
                  This is a feeling that many people struggle with and I am one
                  of those people. I chose a couch because it is empty and I
                  feel that a couch should be warm, comforting and shared with
                  others. In this photo it is shown as dark with red and black
                  shadows to emphasize emptiness.

                Trinity‚Äù. It is an interactive and empowering tool providing
                information about the sensory environments of different areas of
                the college campus, as well as tips on physical access,
                availability of power points, seating, and more. A sensory area
                in Printing House Square refers to a designated space
                categorised by the level of sensory input it provides. These
                areas are classified into high, medium, and low sensory areas
                based on factors such as crowd density, noise levels, and the
                presence of events or room bookings. High sensory areas are
                often crowded and noisy with events, medium sensory areas are
                less crowded with lower noise levels and some events, and low
                sensory areas are the quietest and least crowded, with no
                events, seating, and natural light, making them suitable for
                taking a break.

            <p>
              This series is about my personal experience being neurodivergent
              in the modern world. Being late diagnosed, it can be difficult to
              express my true thoughts without the feeling of scrutiny creeping
              in. This is why I'm very proud to be part of an exhibition that
              uplifts artists in the same position as me and strives to spread
              the positive message of unity.
            </p>
            <h3 class="fw-bold text-accessible-pink">What is art to me?</h3>
            <p>
              As you may be able to recognize from the poems in this series, art
              is to me what it is for most - an outlet for your soul. However, I
              believe it can be used to promote positive change and feelings,
              and this angle, to me, is when art is at its finest.
            </p>
            <h3 class="fw-bold text-accessible-pink">
              What role does art play in building an inclusive future?
            </h3>
            <p>
              As previously mentioned, art's promotion of positive change is
              crucial in building something beautiful. Perhaps one day the right
              words, or lyrics, or any sculpture of feeling can tug the
              heartstrings of those who never knew they had any to begin with.

              of autumn-colored trees with their reflections mirrored in the
              water. A small house with red and white accents sits peacefully by
              the lakeside under a bright blue sky.

            <p>
              To me, art is a voice beyond words. It is a way to express
              emotions, experiences, and perspectives that cannot always be
              easily shared. Art connects us, even when we face barriers.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Writing allows us to share personal stories that might otherwise
              go unheard. By giving voice to our struggles and perspectives,
              written or visual art becomes a bridge to understanding. It's a
              therapeutic and healing process that opens doors for empathy,
              helping others connect with different experiences. In this way,
              art plays a crucial role in building a more inclusive and
              compassionate future.

            </h3>
            <p>
              My piece, "In the Silence, We Hear," is a visual and poetic
              reflection on hearing loss. It features a poem paired with the
              word "inclusion" in sign language. The piece expresses the quiet
              strength of those, including myself, who navigate a world without
              full hearing.

              <strong>ALT Description:</strong> An illustration titled "In the
              Silence, We Hear" featuring hand signs forming letters of the
              alphabet in Irish Sign Language (ISL), with hands of diverse skin
              tones. Below the illustration, a poem explores themes of living in
              silence, navigating a quiet world, and embracing differences. It
              emphasizes that silence is not emptiness but full of unspoken
              meaning, calling for understanding and breaking through barriers
              together. The design combines accessibility awareness with
              inclusivity and empowerment.

              What does Art mean to you?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Art, to me, is a bridge between my inner world and the external
              reality‚Äîa language that mirrors the way my thoughts naturally
              form. It offers a structure that feels more aligned with how I
              process and understand the world, allowing me to translate
              emotions, ideas, and experiences into something tangible. Through
              art, I can express complexities that often feel impossible to
              convey with words, giving shape to what resides within and
              creating a space where others can glimpse and connect with my
              internal landscape.

              Jessica K. Doyle - Trains
            </h3>

            <p>
              <strong>Trains</strong> was written after my first day of college,
              during a moment of reflection as I waited for the train. While I
              stood in stillness, observing, others buzzed with anticipation,
              and the poem captures this contrast‚Äîa quiet contemplation of
              transition and movement and diverse perceptions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>ALT Description:</strong> A poem titled Trains by Jessica
              K. Doyle is presented on a soft beige background with faint train
              track illustrations running vertically along both sides. The poem
              delves into themes of anticipation, movement, and introspection,
              exploring metaphors of trains and their journeys. The imagery
              evokes both physical and emotional travels, capturing fleeting
              moments of reflection and connection. At the bottom, a train track
              loops, symbolizing the continuous journey. The text is laid out in
              a clear, elegant format, complemented by the train motif.

              <strong>Pink Lanes</strong> emerged instinctively, without a
              planned structure, as much of my writing does. It speaks to the

              right, there is a circular abstract illustration in shades of
              pink, purple, and teal, resembling a microscopic or cosmic view.
              The artwork complements the reflective and introspective tone of
              the poem.

            </h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Fizzy Feet</strong> explores the beauty of slowing down
              and taking scenic routes literally and metaphorically. Written in
              a moment of magic and music and connection, though not initially
              about cats, on reflection it reminded me of moments spent walking
              with my two cats, where their curiosity anchors me to the present.
              Their playful exploration reminds me of childhood nostalgia‚Äî muddy
              boots stuck in the muck, little paws and how nature teaches us to
              slow down and immerse ourselves, even in moments of discomfort.
              The poem is also about finding growth and reflection in those
              too-light or too-tight or uncomfortable spaces and the wonder and
              growth one can find in the places we often try to avoid.

              <strong>ALT Description:</strong> A poem titled Fizzy Feet by
              Jessica K. Doyle is written in black text on a soft gradient
              background of green and yellow hues. The poem describes themes of
              reflection, nostalgia, and finding peace. In the bottom-right
              corner, there is a simple black outline drawing of a cat stepping
              into a puddle, its tail raised. The illustration adds a whimsical
              touch to the contemplative tone of the poem.

            <p>
              This artwork is about the frustration and pain that comes with
              having a disability or illness that is not understood by the
              medical community. I have been prescribed medication for my
              chronic pain where the side effects of that medication were more
              pain of the same variety. Doctors are unsure of the origin of your
              pain or how you experience the pain, and so seem to prescribe
              medication based on your explanation of the pain (being
              neurodivergent does not help with this). In this artwork I have
              used my own medication tablets, their side effects, and the 2025
              national gallery of Ireland's calendar.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Art is one of the only ways for marginalised people to express
              themselves in a capitalist society. Through art, marginalised
              people can make themselves and their opinions visible to the
              dominant culture. Hopefully pushing for change not just in the art
              space but in greater society. Through art an individual can also
              process their anger and sadness that occurs in our current system
              of governance.

              Gallery of Ireland calendar with stitched pill blister packs
              pinned across multiple dates, emphasising a sense of routine,
              medicalisation, or health-related themes. The calendar is layered
              with textured backgrounds and imagery, including birds and
              abstract patterns, adding a symbolic or emotional depth to the
              piece. Red threads connect the blister packs, creating a web-like
              visual narrative. This piece reflects themes of time, medication,
              and the impact of health on daily life, presented as part of an
              inclusive art event celebrating diverse perspectives.
